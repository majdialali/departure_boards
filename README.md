-Overview:
In this project, I am going to build a depature boards crawler.  Given the name of a spesific public transport station (= a bus, tram, metro or train stop) from Norway,  the scrawler will fetch live-data of the depature boards for this station.

-implementation:
The user need to log in to use the solution(fetching the departure boards of a station). But before that the user need to be registered in our database. After that if the credintials are correct, the use will have access to the main page. I want to mention that I used 4 api-es, two of them for communication bewteen the frond code(html css and js) and  and the backend code (=the local server and the database), and the two other are for communcation with an external server (the website of Entur). I payed attention to different types errors.


-My stack: 
HTML, CSS and Javascript, Node.js, Express, REST api, GraphQl, NEDB(database)

-requirements:
npm install node/express/nedb
